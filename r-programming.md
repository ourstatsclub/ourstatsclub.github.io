# R Programming

[**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) **is actually a programming environment and language made specifically for graphical applications and statistical computations. It is licensed under the GNU license, just like the S language, which is developed by Bell Laboratories. It is very similar to the S language, though implemented in a different manner. Because of this, some programs written in the S language can also be run in Râ€™s environment, without much alteration.**

**The R language is very useful in the field of statistical computation and data science. It offers various techniques like clustering, time-series analysis, and classification technique, nonlinear/linear modelling and classical statistical tests. Also, this language is very adaptable and extensible. Along with these, it supports many graphical techniques too.**

## **Some background of R:**

  
  
**R is a language and software environment that was made by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka from the University of Auckland in New Zealand. It is used in various fields such as for analysis of statistical information,  graphical representation, and reporting. It is being further developed by the R Development Core Team. R is free under the GNU General Public License and its pre-compiled binary code is available for download. It also supports many operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS.**

**The name of this programming language originates from the initials of the first name of both its creators, which is R. Also, its name can be considered as a play on the name of the S language, which was created by the Bell Laboratories.**

**R was made in the 1990s when programming languages like Redmonk, Tlobe, and PyPL were popular. It is an alternate implementation of the S language, as already stated. R is an important tool for machine learning and statistics, along with numerical analysis.**
