### Introduction

This book was written to give students and statistical enthusiastics who are new to [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), and [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) the tools they need to begin making their statistical analysis skills. R is an open-source programming language that has seen its popularity grow tremendously in recent years, with developers adding new functionality via packages on a daily basis.
